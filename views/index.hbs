                What is a trade lock? At the end of March of 2018 Valve implemented a <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2018/03/20308/">new update to CS:GO trading</a>.
                They restrict the trading of newly received items by locking them to the account for 7 days.
                Once an inventory is loaded there is a countdown displayed for every item that marks the end of this seven-day trade cooldown.
