<h1>Getting replaced by CSGO Trader Chrome Extension</h1>
Hi, this used to be whatstradelocked.com, a site to check when someone's csgo items become tradable.
<p>While I liked developing the site running it was costly and now that there is an even better alternative I am shutting it down.</p>
<p>You can install my new Chrome Extension named CSGO Trader from the <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/csgo-trader/kaibcgikagnkfgjnibflebpldakfhfih/">Chrome Web Store</a>
It has the same and more functions already, and I am planning much more!
</p>
This is what the site used to look:
