==============
It's a a site to check when people's CS:GO items will become tradable - among other things.

It's written in node with express and used to run on Google Appengine then on AWS Elastic Beanstalk

It was expensive to run so I shut it down for a few months.

I decided to bring it back serverlessly as it has minimal cost of running this way and the process of porting it to serverless would be a nice technical challenge.

The process was completed and It's now hosted from AWS Lambda, API Gateway and S3.

It is not going to be updated any more though.
